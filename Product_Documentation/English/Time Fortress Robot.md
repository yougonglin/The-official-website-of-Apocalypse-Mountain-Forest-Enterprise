Users can view health data or touch control software functions, such as detecting indoor temperature, liquid volume, etc.

#### Spliced multi-layer metal shell (14)
Using multi-layer metal plates, different metals can be selected to cope with electromagnetic waves of different frequencies. Short and thick metal cubes are connected to metal plates to ensure compressive strength and are suitable for vacuum environments. The joints around are assembled using pin type assembly, and after assembly, the internal air is evacuated to form a vacuum, providing users with a constant temperature, quiet, safe, and clean resting environment.

#### Incinerator (15)
Using grinding and stirring chemical combustion, the combustion material is broken into small particles, and a combustion aid is added to turn all the small particles into combustible materials. A blower is used to ensure sufficient air in the combustion chamber. After ignition, continuous stirring increases the cavitation space, allowing the combustion material to fully contact oxygen. When the small particles burn simultaneously, the combustion speed is accelerated, and the exhaust gas is discharged harmlessly through a filtration system.

#### The safety factor of traditional houses is relatively low. Embrace new solutions for future rest
The main cabin shell of the device is composed of multiple layers of metal plates. Different types of metal plates can be selected to handle electromagnetic waves in various frequency bands. By increasing its thickness, it can resist most of the radiation.

High strength cubic column alloy is used to connect metal interlayers. The cube columns of the upper and lower connection layers should be misaligned. This structure can resist external impact forces, effectively reduce energy transfer, and play a very positive role in earthquakes or fires.

At the same time, perform vacuum treatment on the intermediate layer. Due to the need for a propagation medium, sound waves can only enter the next layer through a cubic cylinder with a volume of 0.5 cubic centimeters. The staggered cubic columns between multiple layers will disperse sound waves, thereby reducing their penetration and preventing their harm to the human body, such as establishing brain quantum entanglement, biological radar scanning or neural attacks, noise pollution, etc.

In the sealed room constructed in this way, temperature controlled hair dryers are used to strictly control the indoor temperature and create a comfortable resting environment. This can prevent sudden death caused by vasoconstriction due to the cold winter.


#### Medical waterbed and ultrasound are powerful tools for patient rehabilitation
At the lower end of the lifting plate, the robot was originally placed flat on the lifting plate, forming a triangular structure. When introducing external water sources through telescopic water pipes, it can save half of the time to reach the same water level height.

Water bags can be filled with water and used as medical water beds. Every time you take a shower, the water in the water bag can be released and you can immediately take a shower, effectively solving problems such as bacterial growth, long water filling time, and difficulty changing water in the water bed.

The bottom of the bathtub is equipped with an ultrasonic emission group, which can provide full coverage ultrasonic therapy for the person above, such as promoting blood circulation, removing blood stasis, and tissue repair.

#### The combination of bathtub and bed is very useful

It can quickly remove pollutants such as fluids generated during sexual intercourse, dust and bacteria during daily rest, collection and disposal of feces from people with limited mobility, and collection and cleaning of blood during surgery.

#### Efficient household waste fast processing incinerator
This system combines the inspiration of garbage incineration and toilet incineration with robot technology, and can handle household waste (such as feces, medicine boxes, etc.) from dormant individuals (vegetative, disabled, etc.). Example: When a vegetative patient needs to excrete, the robotic arm retrieves a customized garbage bag with double-sided tape at the opening, which is attached and wrapped around the genitals. After excretion, the robotic arm directly takes out the bag and discards it into the incinerator. Then use the above cleaning device to clean the genitals.

#### Provide continuous energy to dormant individuals through a constant speed nutrient solution delivery device
With the advent of collective robots replacing humans, humans are facing the problems of unemployment and excessive leisure time. Poor individuals can only rely on the minimum living allowance to survive. Although basic food and shelter are guaranteed, for those at the bottom of society, experiencing cutting-edge technology is still out of reach - just like past social transformations - because robots mainly improve labor productivity, while resource and knowledge monopolies support the future high consumption economy. With the maturity of brain computer interfaces or MR (mixed reality), perfect sensory feedback can be provided to humans, making more people inclined to live indoors and even maintain a sleep state without wanting to wake up. Travel will be handled by robots. The taste neural interface can provide free food experiences for low-income groups, making real-world dining no longer too expensive. They may choose to consume nutrient solution instead of instant noodles, while also "enjoying" exquisite meals through neural simulation. Therefore, by inserting a constant speed nutrient solution delivery device into the oral cavity and entering a dormant state, individuals can achieve long-term unawakened survival. The device provides a 24-hour supply of nutrients such as vitamins, glucose, and amino acids to maintain bodily function.

#### Biological oxygen production device and full spectrum plant lamp create a micro ecosystem
To prevent insufficient sunlight from affecting human development during long-term indoor living, dormitories should be equipped with full spectrum lights to simulate natural sunlight. Genetically engineered plants with enhanced photosynthetic capacity can continuously produce low-cost oxygen and food indoors, which is particularly valuable in emergency situations such as being trapped during disasters. Backup batteries can ensure that these systems remain operational for a specified period of time. Human excrement can be recycled and reused as fertilizer in this closed-loop ecosystem.

#### Mechanical modification, brain computer interface supporting equipment
Assemble an ultrasonic bone scalpel with a robotic arm and extract a bone from the middle of the forehead. Cultivate one's own artificial biological bone through 3D printing technology, customize its shape, and then implant it into the excised part. The additional bone part in front of the protrusion serves as a compatible interface, which can be used to fix and assemble the robotic eye.

The mechanical eye communicates with the brain computer interface and feeds back the acquired visual data to the brain computer interface. After the brain computer interface processes the image, the information is written into the brain through nerves. Through this method, various drawbacks of MR glasses, such as inconvenient and uncomfortable wearing, as well as dizziness caused by high-speed turns, can be overcome.

In addition, it can enhance functions that the human eye cannot achieve, such as laser night vision (high-energy focused light wave module), telescope vision (high-definition focused camera), perspective (ultrasonic module), and prediction based on vision and sound (AI+high-speed camera). It perfectly realizes real augmented reality scenes.


#### Control patient's cell activity in a low-temperature manner to prolong lifespan
When a patient with a serious illness is on the brink of death, cleaning equipment can be used to thoroughly clean the body, and then neural regulation techniques can be applied to put the patient in a state of suspended animation.

Then, the external low-temperature liquid is introduced through fluid injection into the robotic arm (1), and the human body is placed into the bathtub by the vertical spiral lifting device (6), surrounded by the cooling liquid.

By opening an opening in the brain, coolant can be introduced into the cranial cavity. Afterwards, use a temperature controlled hair dryer to adjust the room temperature to minus 80 degrees Celsius, thereby reducing the activity of cancer cells or viruses.

Brain computer interface technology enables patients to activate certain brain regions, allowing them to manipulate robots to communicate with the outside world even while sleeping.

Computers can perform real-time analysis of health data, regularly lift and lower equipment as needed, and perform corresponding medical processing.

#### Organizational repair and resurrection from death
By collecting and recording 3D brain maps of the target daily, if the target dies from a brain injury that only causes local damage, the damaged area can be repaired through gene editing or nanorobots, and then the brain can be reactivated through a brain computer interface without the need to replicate consciousness to create a replica.

# In terms of technical architecture

programming language
For the backend, choose high-performance compiled languages such as Rust or Golang. This can effectively prevent the intrusion of text-based Trojans such as "single line Trojans", while improving performance and reducing server wear and tear.

#### Server:
Adopting a serverless architecture can effectively reduce personnel maintenance costs and server deployment costs, and security vulnerabilities can be updated immediately.

#### Global high-speed access:
Choose Cloudflare and Tencent Cloud CDN. These two CDNs have advanced DDoS protection and relatively low CC protection costs. They complement each other in solving network latency problems both domestically and internationally.

#### Wireless communication:
Using quantum communication to prevent data from being wirelessly hijacked may lead to confidential information leakage or data modification.

#### Network access:
Use a central artificial intelligence router. It can automatically filter suspicious domain names through big data training. It mandates that requests must appear in the form of a domain name. It will automatically filter out non real name domain names and free domain names. For suspicious request data, it analyzes and reports information from the data sender for manual review and data training. Third party devices also need to use domain names for local area network communication. All LAN IP requests are intercepted to prevent attacks from 'zombie computers'.  

#### Data storage:
Use multiple third-party storage buckets to ensure the security of data storage.

#### Key storage:
For payment keys and login keys, the keys are randomly generated and saved in file format to Google Drive and local files. This ensures that even administrators do not know the key, thereby preventing the leakage of secrets through methods similar to brain reading. These files are encrypted bidirectionally and need to be decrypted when read to prevent file theft. The specially designed key storage in Google Drive makes it impossible to view files even when logged in. Files can only be downloaded with permission when needed and backed up in the cloud to prevent accidental deletion of keys and other situations.

#### Ordinary data:
Data that has little impact on security, such as user information and device configuration, can be flexibly stored for a long time through MongoDB. Redis cache is used to accelerate queries, while Elasticsearch is used to customize searches for multiple data.

#### Sensitive data:
Use blockchain instead of traditional databases for transaction operations, such as modifying points, to ensure that every operation is recorded. Each payment of gas fees can exempt verification codes, avoid generating junk data such as article data, and increase one's income.

#### Sensitive operation:
This application uses payment login to ensure real name authentication of account identity and make it traceable to the host. Use Microsoft's two factor authentication token to ensure that important operations are not compromised.

#### The above solution achieves financial level security protection at the lowest cost, which can greatly prevent hackers from causing serious losses. In the industry, you can refer to companies such as Binance and Tesla.

## Selection of Robot Hardware Configuration and System

#### The main equipment of the robot is equipped with advanced desktop computers
Easy for later self upgrading and maintenance. Adopting the Windows system, it mainly provides users with a graphical user interface and the ability to install more application extension functions.

#### The robotic arm and manipulator are equipped with completely independent computers
This system uses the Sel4 kernel to provide efficient and secure instruction operations. It only receives task instructions from the main device, such as independently calculating and executing processes after performing stitching operations. Compared with Windows, this system has a relatively high level of security, which can prevent major accidents caused by manipulating the robot hand in the event of the main device being invaded.

#### The system adopts a user interaction separation design, with multiple devices operating independently to avoid system intrusion caused by random user operations.

The main device is configured with a computer that can provide high computing power support. An RTX 5090 can provide 3601 TOPS of computing power. If the expected sales of the device exceed one million units, the company can have a computing power of 3.2 billion TOPS or 125 EFLOPS. When users are not using the device, they can perform operations such as renting computing power. The Stargate project in the United States is expected to provide computing power of 200 EFLOPS.

#### Multi application interaction enhances the functionality of robots

All user interaction applications for Windows need to be downloaded through app stores such as Steam and Microsoft Store, while the seL4 system refuses users to install any applications.

#### Prohibit users from installing system level software
To prevent corruption and malicious behavior within other companies. Disable all script commands for untrusted third-party programs.

#### Develop internal system maintenance software
Used for tasks such as junk file cleaning, memory cleaning, real-time health data detection, medical diagnosis, healthcare, robotic surgery, and virus detection

#### Implement dynamic encryption for task instruction transmission between Windows and seL4
To prevent the host from sending random operation commands or stealing user data after being invaded, such as stealing from cameras

# Summary and highlights:

-Because the robot is always connected to the home power supply, it can provide 24-hour continuous power supply, and the computer can provide computing power services to third parties through the Windows system.
-The risk of hackers is particularly deadly when using robots, and separating the user system from the operating system can greatly avoid movie scenes featuring mechanical enemies. No matter how secure users and systems are, they are afraid of internal personnel
-Mechanical arms are not as practical as customized arms in specific fields, and using customized arms can accelerate the popularization of robots.
-The newly designed shielding shell effectively resists impact while significantly reducing energy transfer between the inside and outside, creating a safe hibernation chamber.
-When the lifting plate is applied to coolant scenarios in the future, it can be quickly immersed and lifted for regular physical inspections without the need to drain the liquid, thus avoiding waste and efficiency losses.
-The bottom ultrasound module can provide full body protection during sleep, prevent the invasion of quantum neural regulation, and promote tissue repair.
