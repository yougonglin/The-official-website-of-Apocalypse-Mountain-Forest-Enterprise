#New Design for Future Parking Lots and Residential Rooms

###Design for the Future and Apocalypse
With the popularity of flying cars, more parking platforms are needed, so the outer layer of the triangular body wraps around the circular parking platform to provide more parking spaces while fighting against hurricanes.

###The necessity of a circular platform
The circular parking platform effectively reduces the energy of strong wind impact, and the multi-layered circular platform can provide more parking space.

###Design scheme of circular platform
The lower circular platform has an additional section compared to the upper circular platform, which can provide better takeoff and landing methods. Thus reducing the distance between the annular platforms to increase more annular platforms. Through mathematical calculations, this design provides twice as many parking spaces as an equally wide circular platform.

###The role of pyramids
The lower end of the pyramid enters 800 meters underground, serving as a living quarters for people. This design contributes to the stability of the pyramid. The huge ground stakes can effectively resist earthquakes, and the buried structure can withstand nuclear explosions, floods, radiation, and other emergencies to combat the impending apocalypse.

###The design scheme of the pyramid
The pyramid is made of metal, using my exclusive patent, vacuum multi-layer metal plates, which can isolate a large amount of noise and resist a large amount of radiation. The metal inner layer is made of stainless steel, with excellent insulation effect. Pre made splicing blocks are also extremely convenient to build.

###A trip that goes as you please
As a parking lot for autonomous vehicle, the inner space of the pyramid can park our robot RV, provide a comfortable dynamic lifestyle, and serve as a supply point all over the world.

####Therefore, this design is a perfect wind resistant, earthquake resistant structure, and an extreme doomsday design. This design will change the existing building structure and alter the future living and transportation mode.
