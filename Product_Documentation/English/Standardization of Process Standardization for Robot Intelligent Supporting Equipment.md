![]( https://yougonglin.github.io/The-official-website-of-Apocalypse-Mountain-Forest-Enterprise/website/atlas/anxuquchu.jpg )
### Function:
Fluid can be extracted as needed, especially in the extraction of non Newtonian liquids and solid particles, which have relatively stable outputs.

workmanship
Taking the extraction of non Newtonian stratified turbid liquids as an example, the rotary homogenizer head 9 can be used for preliminary uniform mixing of turbid liquids that have been stationary for a long time. By alternately rotating the double-layer leakage plate 2, the lower leakage plate can control the size of the leakage hole to determine the fluid output for each rotation. By adjusting the speed of the sealing leakage plate through the motor, the output rate of the fluid can be controlled.

The sensitive electronic scale 4 can be used to control one-time output, improve fault tolerance, and avoid liquid blockage. By reversing motor 6, the output mode of the fluid can be controlled, such as outputting a specified mass of fluid at once or continuously outputting a fixed mass of fluid with millisecond level accuracy.

The full spectrum lighting module allows customized loading of experimental light sources as needed, such as ultraviolet, infrared, X-ray, blue light, yellow light, etc. Lighting and visual sensors can monitor real-time changes in reaction phenomena inside the container, such as color and turbidity. Non contact RF sensors can detect the temperature of reactants inside the container. Gravity sensors can detect the degree of reaction in real time to determine the ratio of residual reactants to time. The pump can actively output viscous substances, and the computer can synchronize all the above data to the cloud for timely recording and collaborative use with third-party devices.

workmanship
The customized diversion device can be externally connected through threaded external interface 1, which allows multiple fluids to be introduced simultaneously in different ways and stirred at a fixed speed. For example, different diversion ports of a diversion device (such as a three-way splitter) can be externally connected to a condenser, and a robotic device with intelligent precision switches for grinding funnels can be used to extract solids and drip liquids at a fixed time and in a fixed quantity. Prior to this, different substances can be added to a specified amount through gravity sensor 6, and subsequent operations can be carried out while monitoring the remaining reactants in real-time. Gas collection bottles can also be externally connected to collect reaction gases. The full spectrum emission module can emit ultraviolet light for liquid disinfection or photochemical reaction research inside containers.

## Introduction to the functions of intelligent variable speed incineration robot
![]( https://yougonglin.github.io/The-official-website-of-Apocalypse-Mountain-Forest-Enterprise/website/atlas/fengshaolu.jpg )
The incineration toilet in the RV solves the problem of urination and defecation when there is no water. Inspired by this, this multi-purpose fast incinerator has emerged, solving the problem of burning a piece of feces in an incinerator that takes one hour.

The principle is that while the stirring blades of the intelligent fluid pretreatment and conveying robot device (2) crush combustibles, the combustion liquid is added and stirred along the way through the solid-liquid precision extraction robot device (10), turning every cubic millimeter of non combustibles into combustibles. Then, non-contact rapid ignition is carried out through laser while continuously stirring, increasing the surface area of the combustible material and allowing it to fully contact and burn with oxygen, thereby greatly accelerating the combustion rate.

Store various types of fuel, such as solid powder, liquid, gas, etc., through the fuel tank (8). The combustion fluid can only use 10-20 grams of gasoline, which can be burned in 1-3 minutes at a cost of less than 1 yuan. By using a hair dryer (5), sufficient oxygen can be ensured during the combustion process.

The gravity sensor and mathematical calculation of the intelligent fluid pre-processing and conveying robot device (2) are used to ensure complete combustion of combustibles. If they are not completely burned, a solid-liquid precise extraction robot device (10) can be used to add an appropriate amount of fuel for continuous combustion. After the combustion is completed, reverse the device and pour non combustible materials into the garbage collection device (3).

The combustion exhaust gas is treated through a reverse osmosis device (6) and an aromatic device (8).

### Commercial use:
Incineration bins for various items, such as medical waste and chemical waste. Burning toilets for recreational vehicles or environmental protection purposes. It can be used for baking trays (short-term use, such as grilling meat) and ovens (long-term use, such as grilling whole lambs). When the lid is opened, it can also be used as a gas stove (similar to cooking stoves in rural areas).

### Advantages:
Fast combustion speed, high temperature, good safety of explosion-proof cylinder, and wide application range. It can be externally connected to a steam generator to generate electricity from the emitted gas. This allows for the combustion of waste and the use of thermal energy for cooking, while also generating electricity from steam. Generating electricity from waste can save daily expenses. It contributes to the environment and can also provide electricity in outdoor emergency situations.
