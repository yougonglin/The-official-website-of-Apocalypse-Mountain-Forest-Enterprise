# Don't believe a word, they are all AI virtual humans:
Some dog stuff, after running a satellite over my head to steal trade secrets and design drawings, conducts a second round of pseudo original creation, and then comes to compete with me. Still jokingly calling my original work garbage, with a mix of sadness and anger. They are not good at research and development, but there are some ways to create rhythm. Here are the methods they commonly use
### Means:
-Provoking and provoking (playing the role of a middleman, stirring up trouble at both ends, and provoking trouble)
-Condemnation (splitting into two groups, running to both sides to condemn, escalating the situation, maliciously attracting popularity)
-Bluffing (holding someone else's name, talking about their deeds, pretending to be their own B, may let them deceive some people)
-Reversing black and white (claiming that original products are useless and pirated products are excellent in order to obtain more money and resources)
-Pretend to be a good person (distribute plundered resources to others, recruit new people)
-Find reasons for grievances (downgrade the malignant event, I just like you too much, that's why I raped you)
-Soothing events (pretending to be fake, making false promises, forgive me, I will definitely treat you well in the future)
-Stirring the masses (killing living people and turning them into ghosts, sending them out to speak nonsense together, killing more living people)
-Get rid of the relationship (company deregistration, absconding, legal person responsible, capital tearing)

### Narrator:
The biggest setback I encountered in my life was encountering a group of idiots who messed up my simple plans and turned a cool drama into a useless counterattack. The bastards didn't do anything, but they acted aloof, as if it was his kindness towards me that gave me room for development. Stupid people point fingers at me, refute them, and instead establish me as a foolish and unreasonable person. The entire plan belongs to me. After being plagiarized, how can I appear worthless. Using satellites to monitor my brain and condemning me morally.

# It's actually just a group of fraudsters entertaining themselves
### Intimidation (provoking preparation, making people subconsciously impulsive):
In order to earn some money for themselves, these Chinese people woke me up at 1:00 in the morning, and then sent me a picture of a muscular man to show me his muscles. In addition, they had been threatening me to find someone to fuck me a few days ago. I felt like I had eaten shit and got angry with him from afar. After calming down, I realized that I was really a fool. Leaving people's mouths open (calling me arrogant), writing articles recklessly (cursing others in my tone), and causing trouble (throwing water on me after something happens). Next time I remember, if I encounter such a thing again, just reply: I'm going to call the police.
### Provocation (pointing fingers and reversing black and white):
I haven't been involved in any bullshit Chinese Brain Project, harassment? Intimidation? Instigation? What are they talking about? Justice is just and unyielding. Not only did you not take any action, but you also knelt down. Who doesn't know that they want to provoke me and make false accusations, thinking that their scheme has succeeded and they are proud of it. Play with them the old tricks from 800 years ago and let them bring shame upon themselves.
### Mercy (stealing someone else's belongings and tarnishing one's own image):
Plant crawlers in others' minds, steal their trade secrets, past experiences, and learning techniques. With slight modifications, it was released for free first, making people think it was talented and selfless, and then mocking the original, but the original turned into a stupid plagiarist.
### Exchange (a competition between feces and gold):
These Chinese people, when I blame him, will pull other similar events to bind. Even though one is a pile of feces, once bound to gold, not looking closely will make people think that it is also gold. Similarly, when gold shines, as long as he throws a piece of feces on top of it, the gold will also become smelly.
### Xu Zhang (just a navy with clear division of labor):
Simply put, it's about pretending to be a good person, playing a bad person, and having a few more viewers. Then pull one person to create a topic with another, and the previous navy can build momentum to establish or destroy the relationship between the two. Among them, the identity of the navy was fabricated by oneself, making it easier to carry out related actions.
### Entanglement (they consider themselves guides):
Always holding a satellite and running over someone's head, making noise and disrupting their normal life. They refuse once, twice, countless times. Finally, one day when my mood was unstable, I thought it wasn't a very serious matter and agreed to it. For example, when a person is about to sleep, they release all their psychological defenses and respond to whatever they say.
### Sun Tzu (self deception):
I beg you before doing anything, and I beg you after something happens. Once there is a gap to become a person in charge of things, then you treat yourself as a master and have to do some things for others.
### Summary
Establishing the image of an enemy, attracting hatred towards them, pretending to be a good person, replacing the reputation of others, interfering with the development of the victim, expanding one's own power, and forcing one's grandson to be played as Laozi.

## Gou An can teach Zhuge Liang a lesson
If it were not for being betrayed by a few small boys, and the government's bottom departments bend the law for selfish ends to hide the brain communication Internet from the bottom people. The above conspiracy has long been exposed. Under normal circumstances, they would have died thousands of times. How could they monopolize the media and steal my trade secrets? They have no room for development.
